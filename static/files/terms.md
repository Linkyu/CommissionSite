# Commission Process

Once the payment or deposit is complete, the illustrator will start work as soon as possible. Every commission will have several steps that need to be approved by the commissioner for the work to go on:
 - Preliminary Sketch stage, in which the commissioner will be shown the general composition of the piece.
 - Lineart stage, which finalizes the lines of the piece. 
 - Flats color stage, where the basic colors are filled in.
 - Final stage, where the illustrator completes shading, lighting, and extra effects.

Note that this is the process for a Complete illustration, and will be shorter for the other commission options.

# Delivery

Once the commissioner approves the Final stage, they are given the full high-resolution file and the commission process is complete. 

# Revisions

Throughout the commission, the commissioner can ask for some tweaks to the picture. However, it must be noted that as the commission progresses, accepted changes will be required to be within the current stage. Requesting revisions outside of the current stage, if it can be done, will warrant for an extra charge.
For example: if the piece is in the Flats stage but the commissioner decided they wanted to change the overall pose of the character. Please be mindful when looking at works in progress and don't be afraid to let the illustrator know if something needs changes.


# Rights

The completed illustration's rights are held solely by the commissioner and the illustrator. The commissioner has full rights to the illustration for all personal uses and may not be resold or repurposed by anyone. The illustrator has full rights to display the illustration for any uses, including portfolios and promotional purposes.
Commercial rights have to be negotiated beforehand if necessary.

# Payment

All prices are in USD. Payments will be invoiced and paid via PayPal. The commissioner will have the option to either pay all up-front or pay half now, pay half later. Invoices have a default deadline of 10 days, but the commissioner may request for an extension if necessary.

# Refunds

The latest you can request for a full refund is during the Preliminary Sketch stage. Any refunds requested in the Lineart stage or later will only give a percentage of money back depending on how late in the process the commission is.

# Reservations

While the illustrator is open-minded to all commission ideas, there are some they will NOT do. The illustrator has full right to deny the commission, but as a general rule, the following subjects will be outright denied with no negotation:

 - Extreme gore
 - Illegal content
 - Hate propaganda
 - Shocking material
